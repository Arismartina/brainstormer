### Roadmap
- [ ] Set System Prompt Using User Input: Allow users to customize the system prompt for the AI, tailoring responses to specific needs and preferences.
- [ ] Pass Chat History to the Chat Completion API: Instead of only sending the most recent message, the full chat history will be passed to the API, enabling the AI to maintain context over longer conversations.
- [ ] Convert Whiteboard Elements to Text: Enhance the AI's understanding by exporting scene elements from Excalidraw and converting them to text, rather than just using an image.
- [ ] Add LLM Router: Implement a router that intelligently directs chat input to either a pure LLM or a vision-enabled LLM based on the type of question.
- [ ] Function Calling for Whiteboard Updates: Introduce function calling capabilities, allowing the AI to directly add new elements to the whiteboard based on the conversation.
